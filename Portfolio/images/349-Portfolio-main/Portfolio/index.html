                <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
                <p>I graduated from Claremont High School in 2022 and went on to earn an associate's degree in computer science from Citrus College. My passion for video games, particularly video game design, motivated me to pursue a career in computer science. Beyond my primary academic focus, I am also interested in anthropology and astronomy. I bring strong skills in teamwork, leadership, and analytical thinking, which have been shaped by my experiences playing four years of varsity baseball in high school and one year of college baseball. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, playing video games, playing guitar, and caring for reptiles.</p>

                    <h3>Project 1</h3>

                    <p>In my calculator project, I built a fully functional web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project featured a clean and responsive user interface designed with CSS to ensure usability across devices. Using JavaScript, I implemented the logic to handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as error handling for invalid inputs. This project not only reinforced my skills in front-end development but also demonstrated my ability to integrate functionality and design into a cohesive and user-friendly application.</p>
