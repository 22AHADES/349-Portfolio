                <p>I graduated from Claremont High School in 2022 and went on to earn an associate's degree in computer science from Citrus College. My passion for video games, particularly video game design, motivated me to pursue a career in computer science. Beyond my primary academic focus, I am also interested in anthropology and astronomy. I bring strong skills in teamwork, leadership, and analytical thinking, which have been shaped by my experiences playing four years of varsity baseball in high school and one year of college baseball. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, playing video games, playing guitar, and caring for reptiles.</p>
